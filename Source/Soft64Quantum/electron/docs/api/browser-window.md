# BrowserWindow

> Create and control browser windows.

```javascript
// In the main process.
const BrowserWindow = require('electron').BrowserWindow;

// Or in the renderer process.
const BrowserWindow = require('electron').remote.BrowserWindow;

var win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600, show: false });
win.on('closed', function() {
  win = null;
});

win.loadURL('https://github.com');
win.show();
```

You can also create a window without chrome by using
[Frameless Window](frameless-window.md) API.

## Class: BrowserWindow

`BrowserWindow` is an
[EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter).

It creates a new `BrowserWindow` with native properties as set by the `options`.

    below.
  * `webPreferences` Object - Settings of web page's features. See more about
    this below.

The possible values and behaviors of `type` option are platform dependent,
supported values are:

* On Linux, possible types are `desktop`, `dock`, `toolbar`, `splash`,
  `notification`.
* On OS X, possible types are `desktop`, `textured`.
  * The `textured` type adds metal gradient appearance
    (`NSTexturedBackgroundWindowMask`).
  * The `desktop` type places the window at the desktop background window level
    (`kCGDesktopWindowLevel - 1`). Note that desktop window will not receive
    focus, keyboard or mouse events, but you can use `globalShortcut` to receive
    input sparingly.

The `titleBarStyle` option is only supported on OS X 10.10 Yosemite and newer.
Possible values are:

* `default` or not specified, results in the standard gray opaque Mac title
  bar.
* `hidden` results in a hidden title bar and a full size content window, yet
  the title bar still has the standard window controls ("traffic lights") in
  the top left.
* `hidden-inset` results in a hidden title bar with an alternative look
  where the traffic light buttons are slightly more inset from the window edge.

The `webPreferences` option is an object that can have following properties:

* `nodeIntegration` Boolean - Whether node integration is enabled. Default
  is `true`.
* `preload` String - Specifies a script that will be loaded before other
  scripts run in the page. This script will always have access to node APIs
  no matter whether node integration is turned on or off. The value should
  be the absolute file path to the script.
  When node integration is turned off, the preload script can reintroduce
  Node global symbols back to the global scope. See example
  [here](process.md#event-loaded).
* `session` [Session](session.md#class-session) - Sets the session used by the
  page. Instead of passing the Session object directly, you can also choose to
  use the `partition` option instead, which accepts a partition string. When
  both `session` and `partition` are provided, `session` would be preferred.
  Default is the default session.
* `partition` String - Sets the session used by the page according to the
  session's partition string. If `partition` starts with `persist:`, the page
  will use a persistent session available to all pages in the app with the
  same `partition`. if there is no `persist:` prefix, the page will use an
  in-memory session. By assigning the same `partition`, multiple pages can share
  the same session. Default is the default session.
* `zoomFactor` Number - The default zoom factor of the page, `3.0` represents
  `300%`. Default is `1.0`.
* `javascript` Boolean - Enables JavaScript support. Default is `true`.
* `webSecurity` Boolean - When setting `false`, it will disable the
  same-origin policy (Usually using testing websites by people), and set
  `allowDisplayingInsecureContent` and `allowRunningInsecureContent` to
  `true` if these two options are not set by user. Default is `true`.
* `allowDisplayingInsecureContent` Boolean - Allow an https page to display
  content like images from http URLs. Default is `false`.
* `allowRunningInsecureContent` Boolean - Allow a https page to run
  JavaScript, CSS or plugins from http URLs. Default is `false`.
* `images` Boolean - Enables image support. Default is `true`.
* `textAreasAreResizable` Boolean - Make TextArea elements resizable. Default
  is `true`.
* `webgl` Boolean - Enables WebGL support. Default is `true`.
* `webaudio` Boolean - Enables WebAudio support. Default is `true`.
* `plugins` Boolean - Whether plugins should be enabled. Default is `false`.
* `experimentalFeatures` Boolean - Enables Chromium's experimental features.
  Default is `false`.
* `experimentalCanvasFeatures` Boolean - Enables Chromium's experimental
  canvas features. Default is `false`.
* `directWrite` Boolean - Enables DirectWrite font rendering system on
  Windows. Default is `true`.
* `blinkFeatures` String - A list of feature strings separated by `,`, like
  `CSSVariables,KeyboardEventKey`. The full list of supported feature strings
  can be found in the [setFeatureEnabledFromString][blink-feature-string]
  function.
* `defaultFontFamily` Object - Sets the default font for the font-family.
  * `standard` String - Defaults to `Times New Roman`.
  * `serif` String - Defaults to `Times New Roman`.
  * `sansSerif` String - Defaults to `Arial`.

## Events

The `BrowserWindow` object emits the following events:

**Note:** Some events are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

### Event: 'page-title-updated'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the document changed its title, calling `event.preventDefault()`
would prevent the native window's title to change.

### Event: 'close'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window is going to be closed. It's emitted before the
`beforeunload` and `unload` event of the DOM. Calling `event.preventDefault()`
will cancel the close.

Usually you would want to use the `beforeunload` handler to decide whether the
window should be closed, which will also be called when the window is
reloaded. In Electron, returning an empty string or `false` would cancel the
close. For example:

```javascript
window.onbeforeunload = function(e) {
  console.log('I do not want to be closed');

  // Unlike usual browsers, in which a string should be returned and the user is
  // prompted to confirm the page unload, Electron gives developers more options.
  // Returning empty string or false would prevent the unloading now.
  // You can also use the dialog API to let the user confirm closing the application.
  e.returnValue = false;
};
```

### Event: 'closed'

Emitted when the window is closed. After you have received this event you should
remove the reference to the window and avoid using it anymore.

### Event: 'unresponsive'

Emitted when the web page becomes unresponsive.

### Event: 'responsive'

Emitted when the unresponsive web page becomes responsive again.

### Event: 'blur'

Emitted when the window loses focus.

### Event: 'focus'

Emitted when the window gains focus.

### Event: 'show'

Emitted when the window is shown.

### Event: 'hide'

Emitted when the window is hidden.

### Event: 'maximize'

Emitted when window is maximized.

### Event: 'unmaximize'

Emitted when the window exits from maximized state.

### Event: 'minimize'

Emitted when the window is minimized.

### Event: 'restore'

Emitted when the window is restored from minimized state.

### Event: 'resize'

Emitted when the window is getting resized.

### Event: 'move'

Emitted when the window is getting moved to a new position.

__Note__: On OS X this event is just an alias of `moved`.

### Event: 'moved' _OS X_

Emitted once when the window is moved to a new position.

### Event: 'enter-full-screen'

Emitted when the window enters full screen state.

### Event: 'leave-full-screen'

Emitted when the window leaves full screen state.

### Event: 'enter-html-full-screen'

Emitted when the window enters full screen state triggered by html api.

### Event: 'leave-html-full-screen'

Emitted when the window leaves full screen state triggered by html api.

### Event: 'app-command' _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `command` String

Emitted when an [App Command](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646275(v=vs.85).aspx)
is invoked. These are typically related to keyboard media keys or browser
commands, as well as the "Back" button built into some mice on Windows.

Commands are lowercased with underscores replaced with hyphens and the
`APPCOMMAND_` prefix stripped off.
e.g. `APPCOMMAND_BROWSER_BACKWARD` is emitted as `browser-backward`.

```javascript
someWindow.on('app-command', function(e, cmd) {
  // Navigate the window back when the user hits their mouse back button
  if (cmd === 'browser-backward' && someWindow.webContents.canGoBack()) {
    someWindow.webContents.goBack();
  }
});
```

### Event: 'scroll-touch-begin' _OS X_

Emitted when scroll wheel event phase has begun.

### Event: 'scroll-touch-end' _OS X_

Emitted when scroll wheel event phase has ended.

### Event: 'swipe' _OS X_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `direction` String

Emitted on 3-finger swipe. Possible directions are `up`, `right`, `down`, `left`.

## Methods

The `BrowserWindow` object has the following methods:

### `BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()`

Returns an array of all opened browser windows.

## Instance Properties

Objects created with `new BrowserWindow` have the following properties:

```javascript
// In this example `win` is our instance
var win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 });
```

### `win.webContents`

The `WebContents` object this window owns, all web page related events and
operations will be done via it.

See the [`webContents` documentation](web-contents.md) for its methods and
events.

### `win.id`

The unique ID of this window.

## Instance Methods

Objects created with `new BrowserWindow` have the following instance methods:

**Note:** Some methods are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

### `win.destroy()`

Force closing the window, the `unload` and `beforeunload` event won't be emitted
for the web page, and `close` event will also not be emitted
for this window, but it guarantees the `closed` event will be emitted.

### `win.close()`

Try to close the window, this has the same effect with user manually clicking
the close button of the window. The web page may cancel the close though, see
the [close event](#event-close).

### `win.focus()`

Focus on the window.

### `win.blur()`

Remove focus on the window.

### `win.isFocused()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is focused.

### `win.show()`

Shows and gives focus to the window.

### `win.showInactive()`

Shows the window but doesn't focus on it.

### `win.hide()`

Hides the window.

### `win.isVisible()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is visible to the user.

### `win.maximize()`

Maximizes the window.

### `win.unmaximize()`

Unmaximizes the window.

### `win.isMaximized()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is maximized.

### `win.minimize()`

Minimizes the window. On some platforms the minimized window will be shown in
the Dock.

### `win.restore()`

Restores the window from minimized state to its previous state.

### `win.isMinimized()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is minimized.

### `win.setFullScreen(flag)`

* `flag` Boolean

Sets whether the window should be in fullscreen mode.

### `win.isFullScreen()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is in fullscreen mode.

### `win.setAspectRatio(aspectRatio[, extraSize])` _OS X_

* `aspectRatio` The aspect ratio we want to maintain for some portion of the
content view.
* `extraSize` Object (optional) - The extra size not to be included while
maintaining the aspect ratio.

This will have a window maintain an aspect ratio. The extra size allows a
developer to have space, specified in pixels, not included within the aspect
ratio calculations. This API already takes into account the difference between a
window's size and its content size.

Consider a normal window with an HD video player and associated controls.
Perhaps there are 15 pixels of controls on the left edge, 25 pixels of controls
on the right edge and 50 pixels of controls below the player. In order to
maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio (standard aspect ratio for HD @1920x1080) within
the player itself we would call this function with arguments of 16/9 and
[ 40, 50 ]. The second argument doesn't care where the extra width and height
are within the content view--only that they exist. Just sum any extra width and
height areas you have within the overall content view.

### `win.setBounds(options[, animate])`
