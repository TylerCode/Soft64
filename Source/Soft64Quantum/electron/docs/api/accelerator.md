# Accelerator

> Define keyboard shortcuts.

Accelerators can contain multiple modifiers and key codes, combined by
the `+` character.

Examples:

* `CommandOrControl+A`
* `CommandOrControl+Shift+Z`

## Platform notice

On Linux and Windows, the `Command` key does not have any effect so
use `CommandOrControl` which represents `Command` on OS X and `Control` on
Linux and Windows to define some accelerators.

Use `Alt` instead of `Option`. The `Option` key only exists on OS X, whereas
the `Alt` key is available on all platforms.

The `Super` key is mapped to the `Windows` key on Windows and Linux and
`Cmd` on OS X.
