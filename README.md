# About this Project #
This is a free-time project I have fun working on while learning modern desktop application design.  I like to take apart machines and learn how they work, I want to build a professional like emulator for N64 game console with an interactive debugger and user-friendly emulator interface.  There is a lot of things I like to do in this emulator, to make it a full application of various things like teaching the user how N64 works just based on the tools built-in.

# Hmm, Soft64.zip link on another website? #
Why even bother distributing builds of this project?  It's still work in progress, and changes can happen so fast that other emulator acrhive sites may have trouble building the project at certain stages.  If you are a developer, its fine if you clone the repo and test it, else don't bother creating a zip file on a mirror file server. This emulator is not at the point yet to run a game for end users, its still in technical stages and still lacks the RCP core.  Note to all emulator 'reporters', providing a few screenshots and information would be prefered to allow people see the current progress, perhaps it will attract other developers to want to help with the project.  A note to end-users, only download zip files provided by this project page, that means the emulator is working and has been released, other sites could be some kind of scam. That is all.
