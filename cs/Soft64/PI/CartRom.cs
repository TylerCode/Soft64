/* = NOTES ==============================
 * Rom should have its own custom checksum in case the emulator wants check if has been modified in RAM
 * The CRC could be its own type to make it simpler to reference
 *
 * = Byte-swapping Notes =================
 * All rom images are Big endian binary format for the N64, so they MUST be byteswapped for our Intel machines.
 * There are 2 kinds of cartridge dumps we must account for when doing byteswapping (.z64 are already swapped to Intel binary format)
 * .v64 - swapped every half word (this is more rare)
 * .n64 - big endian format, has to be swapped every 4 bytes
 *
 * = PI Bus Notes =======================
 * The PI manages its own bus which has special features allow different memory configuations based on the attachements connected to the system board.  Originally
 * the N64 was going to have a diskdrive and a cartridge be attached at the same time to increase ROM space and provide more RAM too.  Since the diskdrive
 * failed before launch, all the unused cartridge domains became use for accessing flash memory instead.  This is my educated guess since the PI maintains
 * reserved regions on the PI bus called Cartridge Domains.  Each domain has its own configurable bus timing, and it is obvious that the diskdrive was going
 * to add more memory to those domains such as more readable Rom (the disk itself), and its own drive memory increasing RAM to 16MB (my guess.)  I know for the fact
 * that cartridges provides save memory (SRAM) that mounted always to one of the domains.  The cartridge ROM size is limited probably due to the built-in reserved
 * domain size that always access the inserted cartridge ROM.  Another interesting thing, is there is a domain that is past the PIF boundaries and its function is
 * unknown.  It is likely unimportant and never used, even with a diskdrive mounted.
